'lookup' is performed independently of 'opendir' --> 'readdir' --> 'releasedir' cycle.

stat.st_nlink can be '1' in the case of linux, the number of links to the directory ie. the inode references from within other directories ( the original dirent + any '..' files in subdirectories ),
    or in the case of OSX st_nlink can be the actual number of dirents inside the directory.
