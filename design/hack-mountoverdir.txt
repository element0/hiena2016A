== HACK:  mount over dir ==

--------


== DESCRIPTION: ==

Is it possible to use a directory as source
for a mountpoint over directory.

SOURCE="/home/raygan"
MOUNTPOINT= "/home/raygan"

--------

== EVALUATION TEST: ==

We need to know if we can open SOURCE for reading and writing.
	and if we can access ALL its subdirectories and files.
	--
	create a file crawler

At the same time we mount a FUSE filespace (of any make and model)
    	over the MOUNTPOINT
	and access its contents
	--
	use sshfs to mount a different directory from the localhost
