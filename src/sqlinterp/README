SQL Interpreter Built-in

using the "sql()" callback function, the lookup module can invoke an SQL statement on the current lookup frame.

A domain stream has two abstract "tables".  A "child table" and an "attributes table".  An SQL statement may select FROM "children" or "attributes".

A lookup frame may have other abstract tables.  this is tbd.
